# KuFlow Client Java

> ***"KuFlow is a platform on which you can design and execute your business processes"***

In KuFlow we are engineers and therefore we like concrete things; we like to know 'the how' because it is the only way to understand how a platform can solve our problems.

It is a compilation of libraries and examples that you can use for the implementation of your Workers that connect to our system. 

KuFlow is an implementation language agnostic Cloud platform. This repository is useful if you as a customer develop your integrations in JAVA.

## Documentation

Documentation on how to integrate with KuFlow using Java is available [here](https://docs.kuflow.com/developers/guides/java).
